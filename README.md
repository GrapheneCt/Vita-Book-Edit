# Vita-Book-Edit

Application that adds EPUBS to the PS Vita into a format compatible with the Vita's "Reader" Application.
Note:
The Vita only reads EPUBs with image files as pages and a maximum size of 1.2 MB.

To Do:
-Book Gallery Categorization 
-Extensive Testing and Bug Fixing.
-Add EPUB conversion instructions
-Have the application loop through all DLC folders while clearing empty folders or updating the gallery

Far Future:
-Connect to a Book Database e.g Good Reads and Download data automatically.
